    int     arg2,
    int     arg3,
    int     arg4,
    int     arg5,
    int     arg6,

repeat( )

NAME

repeat( ) - spawn a task to call a function repeatedly

SYNOPSIS

int repeat
    (
    int     n,                /* no. of times to call func (0=forever) */
    FUNCPTR func,             /* function to call repeatedly */
    int     arg1,             /* first of eight args to pass to func */
    int     arg2,
    int     arg3,
    int     arg4,
    int     arg5,
    int     arg6,
    int     arg7,
    int     arg8
    )
DESCRIPTION

This command spawns a task that calls a specified function n times, with up to eight of its arguments. If n is 0, the routine is called endlessly, or until the spawned task is deleted.

NOTE

The task is spawned using sp( ). See the description of sp( ) for details about priority, options, stack size, and task ID.
*****************
period( )

NAME

period( ) - spawn a task to call a function periodically

SYNOPSIS

int period
    (
    int     secs,             /* period in seconds */
    FUNCPTR func,             /* function to call repeatedly */
    int     arg1,             /* first of eight args to pass to func */
    int     arg2,
    int     arg3,
    int     arg4,
    int     arg5,
    int     arg6,
    int     arg7,
    int     arg8
    )
DESCRIPTION

This command spawns a task that repeatedly calls a specified function, with up to eight of its arguments, delaying the specified number of seconds between calls.

For example, to have i( ) display task information every 5 seconds, just type:

    -> period 5, i
NOTE

The task is spawned using the sp( ) routine. See the description of sp( ) for details about priority, options, stack size, and task ID.

taskShow( )

NAME

taskShow( ) - display task information from TCBs

SYNOPSIS

STATUS taskShow
    (
    int tid,                  /* task ID */
    int level                 /* 0 = summary, 1 = details, 2 = all tasks */
    )
DESCRIPTION

This routine displays the contents of a task control block (TCB) for a specified task. If level is 1, it also displays task options and registers. If level is 2, it displays all tasks.

The TCB display contains the following fields:

Field	Meaning
NAME	Task name
ENTRY	Symbol name or address where task began execution
TID	Task ID
PRI	Priority
STATUS	Task status, as formatted by taskStatusString( )
PC	Program counter
SP	Stack pointer
ERRNO	Most recent error code for this task
DELAY	If task is delayed, number of clock ticks remaining in delay (0 otherwise)
EXAMPLE

The following example shows the TCB contents for the shell task:

  -> taskShow tShell, 1

    NAME        ENTRY    TID    PRI  STATUS      PC       SP    ERRNO  DELAY
